# HSResearchProject
This is my High School research project on the Brachistochrone Problem for which I was awarded an A* grade. It covers topics such as the Calculus of Variations,
building it from the ground up and then using it to solve the Brachistochrone Problem itself, as well as the history of the problem from Galileo to Newton and the Bernoulli Brothers. Open E_Q(1).pdf for the project PDF.
